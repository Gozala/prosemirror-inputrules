ProseMirror is a well-behaved rich semantic content editor based on
contentEditable, with support for collaborative editing and custom
document schemas.

This [module](http://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#inputrules) exports a
plugin that can be used to define _input rules_, things that should
happen when input matching a given pattern is typed, along with a
number of predefined rules.

The [project page](http://prosemirror.net) has more information, a
number of [examples](http://prosemirror.net/examples/) and the
[documentation](http://prosemirror.net/docs/).
